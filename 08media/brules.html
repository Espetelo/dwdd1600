            <ol>
                <li>No one knows exactly when soccer was created, but the earliest versions of the game can be traced back 3,000 years.</li>
                <li>Soccer is the most popular game in the world. In many countries it is known as “football”.</li>
                <li>In China, the first soccer balls were made from sewn clothing that was filled with rubble. In Europe during the Middle Ages, soccer balls were made from inflated pig bladders.</li>
                <li>Soccer is played on a grassy field called a pitch. The field is rectangular and must be between 100 and 130 yards long and 50 to 100 yards wide.</li>
                <li>An international soccer game is 90 minutes long. The 90 minutes is divided in two 45 minute halves.</li>
