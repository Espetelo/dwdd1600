Here you will be able to learn various skills that will enable you to go to a soccer field and have valid opinions. Here is a quick break down of this website, to help you decide where you need to start.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic Rules:</strong> These are simple rules that are enforeced at all ages of play</li>
                <li><strong>Complicated Rules:</strong> These are more complex rules that are usually only enforeced at a higher age / skill level.</li>
                <li><strong>Choose your team:</strong> I will help you decide which team or teams you would enjoy rooting for. (you cant just pick the team that has your favorite color jersey anymore)</li>
                <li><strong>How to cheer:</strong> I will give you instructions on using context clues to cheer at appropriate times.</li>
                <li><strong>How to boo:</strong> I will give you instructions on using context clues to boo at appropriate times, so that you dont get kicked out. ...... Unless you do, which is why I include the last segment.</li>
                <li><strong>How to get kicked out:</strong> You can either use this to try and get removed from a game, or to know what not to do so you can keep the seats you paid for.</li> 
            </ul>
